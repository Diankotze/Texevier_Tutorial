  This is my first attempt at producing a paper using texevier. The purpose is to teach us how to write in texevier, and include tables and figures, similar to what we will experience when doing our project. This is revolutionary.

<!-- First: Set your default preferences for chunk options: -->

<!-- If you want a chunk's code to be printed, set echo = TRUE. message = FALSE stops R printing ugly package loading details in your final paper too. I also suggest setting warning = FALSE and checking for warnings in R, else you might find ugly warnings in your paper. -->

```{r setup, include=FALSE}

# Question 1 \label{Period 1 and 2 Moments}

The following results are the first and second moments for the periods 2006-2008, and 2010-2013. The values are very small, and with two decimal places, some of the values appear to have mean and variance values of zero, which is not the case. Moreover, I have interpreted that the sample ends at the end of the previous year for both samples.

  * 2006-2008
  
```{r Table1, results = 'asis'}

library(xtable)

table <- xtable(Moments_period1, caption = "Moments of the stocks for 2006-2008 \\label{tab1}")
  print.xtable(table, 
             floating = TRUE,
             table.placement = 'H', 
             comment = FALSE,
             caption.placement = 'bottom'
             )
```
  
  * 2010-2013
```{r Table2, results = 'asis'}

library(xtable)

table <- xtable(Moments_period2, caption = "Moments of the stocks for 2010-2013 \\label{tab1}")
  print.xtable(table, 
             floating = TRUE,
             table.placement = 'H', 
             comment = FALSE,
             caption.placement = 'bottom'
             )
```

The most notable differences between the two periods is the negative mean values in period 1 (2006-2008) for ABSP and NBKP. Additionally, the variance between the two periods differs substantially for every stock except NBKP and RMH. ABSP has the highest variance in returns across both periods, suggesting that it is the most volatile of the stocks [@Texevier \& @Tsay1989]. 

# Question 2: Calculating the full sample correlations between the stocks \label{Question 2: Calculate the full sample correlations between the stocks}

```{r Table3, results='asis'}

print.xtable(xtable(cor(dailydata[, c(2,3,4,5,6,7,8)], use = "complete.obs"), caption = "Unconditional Correlations Between Stocks \\label{t}"),
             floating = TRUE,
             table.placement = 'H', 
             scalebox = "0.7",
             comment = FALSE,
             caption.placement = 'bottom'
             )
```

# Question 3: Plot the univariate GARCH ht processes for each of the series \label{Question 3: Plot the univariate GARCH ht processes for each of the series}

Note that "Data_wide"" is created which has the log returns of all the stocks. This data has been spread, after the log returns were calclulated for each stocks from the dailydata.

```{r figure1, warning =  FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "GARCH Plot \\label{lit}", fig.ext = 'png'}

source("code/GARCH_calculations.R")
plot(garchfit1, which = "all")

```

# Question 4: Plot the cumulative returns series of a portfolio that is equally weighted to each of the stocks - reweighted each year on the last day of June \label{Question 4}

```{r figure2, warning =  FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Cumulative returns plot- equally weighted \\label{lit}", fig.ext ='png'}

source("code/Cumulative_return_calculation.R")

ggplot(Cumulative_portfolio_eqw) + 
  geom_line(aes(date,cumulative_ret), color = "Red") +
  theme_bw() + labs(title = "Equally Weighted Portfolio's Cumulative Returns")
```

Unfortunately I was unable to reweight the portfolio on the last day of June each year. I tried using what was provided in practical 5, and I have the intuition behind it. However, there appears to be an error in my code (clearly I am missing something).

As such, this brings an end to my first paper produced in texevier. Excting times ahead!
